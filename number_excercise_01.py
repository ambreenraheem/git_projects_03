# Question :2

print('''
      2.you bought 9 packets of potato chips from a store.

# Question :3 suggested code

print('''
      3.A snail is at the bottom of a 25 meter high cliff.

# Question: 4
print('''
      4.You want to replace tiles in your bathroom which is exactly square and 5.5 feet is its length. 
      If tiles cost 500 rs per square feet, how much will be the total cost to replace all tiles.
      Calculate and print the cost using python (Hint: Use power operator ** to find area of a square''')
tile_price=500            #rs/square foot
